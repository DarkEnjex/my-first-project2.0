        <p class="title-text">The Speed Force is a cosmic energy field and force based around velocity and movement, and
            one of the Seven
            Forces of
            the Universe. It is the representation of reality in motion, being the very cosmic force that pushes space
            and time
            forward. It grants all speedsters their power. Several speedsters have merged with it, including Barry
            Allen, Johnny
            Quick, and Max Mercury. Eobard Thawne stated that at its core, the Speed Force is equivalent to time itself,
            describing
            it as existence moving through reality, kinetic energy, and temporal energy.</p>
